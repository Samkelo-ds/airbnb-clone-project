## 🛠️ Technology Stack

Here are the main tools and technologies used to build the Airbnb Clone backend, along with what they do:

### ⚙️ Django
A Python web framework used to build and manage the backend logic and API routes.

### 🌐 Django REST Framework (DRF)
Helps create RESTful APIs that allow users to interact with the backend (e.g., sign up, list properties).

### 🗃️ PostgreSQL
A powerful and reliable database used to store all the data — like user profiles, bookings, and payments.

### 🔎 GraphQL
A query language used for asking the backend only for the data you need — more flexible than traditional REST.

### ⏳ Celery
Used to handle background tasks like sending emails, notifications, or processing long-running jobs.

### ⚡ Redis
An in-memory data store used for caching (making things faster) and session management.

### 📦 Docker
Used to package the app into containers so it runs the same on every computer or server.

### 🚀 CI/CD Pipelines
Automated tools that help test, build, and deploy the app faster and safer.
